# Rancid Tomatillos
### Abstract

This project is a multi-page web React application designed to emulate a movie review aggregator website (Ã  la Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb). Utilizing a set of remote databases, the application presents the user with various movie data (runtime, average rating, budget, revenue, etc.) as well as a movie trailer. The project also includes a Cypress.io acceptance test suite.

### Project Context

This project was created by a fully-remote team of two for the Front-End Engineering program at Turing School of Software & Engineering. Being our first project of the program using React, we were expected to demonstrate best practices for React, along with using Cypress for acceptance testing and React Router. We spent roughly 10 hours each working on the project.
